## Challenges
+ How to find the balance between the "safety" and the maximum food carried.
+ How to adjust different stategies to different mpas, i.e. maps without capsules
## Future Improvement
+ Deadends detection
+ Using a sophisticate stategy to find another optimal entry to their field when our attacker faces their defender directly in the border
